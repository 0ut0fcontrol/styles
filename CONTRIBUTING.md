# Guide to Submitting CSL Styles (and CSL Locales)

The CSL style repository is the central location on the web for collecting and maintaining CSL styles.
Software products like Zotero, Mendeley, and Papers all draw their styles from our repository.

We welcome style submissions (and corrections), and are particularly interested in styles for journals and published style guides.
If you wish to submit a different type of style, please first check our [Criteria for Accepting Styles](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Criteria-for-Accepting-Styles).

To submit a style, please follow the following steps (for locale files, follow the same steps in the  [locales](https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales) repository):

#### 1. Check that your style meets all our [style requirements](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Style-Requirements).

#### 2. [Validate](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Validation) your style against the CSL schema, and correct any validation errors.

#### 3. Submit the style.

The fastest way to get a style accepted into our repository is by creating a **pull request** on the GitHub website.
To start, create a GitHub account and sign in.

##### 3a. Submitting a new style

1. Visit https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles and click the "Create new file" button.
   When submitting a [dependent style](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Requesting-Styles#dependent-styles), first navigate to the [dependent](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/tree/master/dependent) subdirectory.
2. Type in the file name of the style in the "Name your file..." text field at the top.
   Don't forget to add the ".csl" extension (e.g., "journal-of-results.csl" instead of just "journal-of-results")!
3. Paste the style code into the "<> Edit new file" tab below.
4. Click the "Propose new file" button.
5. In the next window, click the "Create pull request" button.
   Describe the changes you've made, and click the "Create pull request" button once more.

(for more help, see GitHub's instructions on [Creating new files](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files))

##### 3b. Submitting changes to an existing style

1. Visit https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles and find the style you wish to change (dependent styles are stored in the [dependent](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/tree/master/dependent) subdirectory).
   To search by file name press "t" (this activates GitHubâ€™s [File Finder](https://github.com/blog/793-introducing-the-file-finder)) and start typing.
2. Click on the style name, which will bring you to a page like https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa.csl.
3. Click the edit icon (in the shape of a pencil).
   This opens a code editor in which you can make your changes (you can for example copy and paste your modified style into this window).
4. Once you have made your changes in the "<> Edit file" tab (and previewed the changes in the "Preview changes" tab), click the "Propose file change" button.
5. In the next window, click the "Create pull request" button.
   Describe the changes you've made, and click the "Create pull request" button once more.

(for more help, see GitHub's instructions on [Editing files in another user's repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository))

Instead of relying solely on the GitHub website, you can also use a git client, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Mac and Windows, or [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).
When using a client, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [style repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles), create a branch off of "master", commit your changes, and then create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

#### 4. Check on your pull request.

After you create a pull request, tests are automatically run to verify that your style validates and follows our style requirements.

These **Travis CI** tests usually finish within a few minutes.
If Travis CI finds no problems, a green checkmark will appear in your pull request.
Otherwise, you will see a red X.
Click this X to see the build report, which describes the identified errors.
If you have trouble figuring out what's wrong with your pull request, post a comment in the pull request and ask for help. When Travis CI finds problems with your style, don't create a new pull request.
Instead, correct the existing one (see below).

We also have a handful of volunteers who review pull requests.
We will often ask you to provide some extra information about the style you're submitting, or ask you to make some changes to your pull request.
Once we are satisfied, we will **merge** the pull request.

Sometimes we merge pull requests within the hour, and sometimes it takes a few days.
This depends on how busy we are, and on the time it takes to get your style in acceptable shape.
In general, the closer you follow our instructions detailed here, the faster we can accept your style.

#### 5. Update your pull request.

To make changes to your pull request, visit the "Files changed" tab of your pull request, and then click the "View" button at the top of your style.
This should bring you to the copy of the style in your own fork of the styles repository.
Finally, click on the edit icon, and make your changes.

Any changes made this way will automatically appear in the pull request, and each commit will trigger a new Travis CI report.

#### 6. Make additional changes after your pull request has been merged.

Once a pull request has been merged, it can no longer be used to submit further changes.
If you do wish to make additional changes, create a new pull request.
Please always start from the latest version of the style from our repository, because we often perform maintenance on styles.
